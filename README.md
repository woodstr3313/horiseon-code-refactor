# horiseon-code-refactor
This website shows a single webpage created for a Horiseon marketing agency. This page was optimized for search engines. This project was created with symantic HTML and CSS styling. I was provided the starter code for both the HTLM and CSS files. I made modifications by removing div tags and replacing with the appropriate symantic elements. I also consolidated replicated css code.
